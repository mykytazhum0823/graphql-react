# React Popper

`react-popper` is the official React wrapper to let you use Popper in your React
projects.

It exposes an API very similar to the one of the Vanilla JavaScript library, but
it provides some useful addition to better integrate with React.

All the DOM mutations are deferred to the user, the consumer receives a set of
CSS rules and HTML attributes that can then be applied to the required elements
using the preferred approach (be it a basic `style` prop, a CSS-in-JS library,
or else).

You can find the most recent [documentation here](./v2/).
