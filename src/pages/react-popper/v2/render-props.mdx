# Render Props

> This is a legacy API for compatibility with v1.x users moving to Popper v2. We

The `Manager` component is a simple wrapper that needs to surround all the other
`react-popper` components in order to make them communicate with each others.

The `Popper` component accepts the properties `children`, `placement`,
`modifiers` and `strategy`.

<x-ad />

```jsx
<Popper
  innerRef={(node) => this.popperNode = node}
  placement="right"
  modifiers={[{ name: 'preventOverflow', enabled: false }]}
  strategy="fixed"
>
    { props => [...] }
</Popper>
```

### `children`

```js
children: ({|
  ref: (?HTMLElement) => void,
  style: { [string]: string | number },
  placement: ?Placement,
  isReferenceHidden: ?boolean,
  hasPopperEscaped: ?boolean,
  update: () => void,
  forceUpdate: () => void,
  arrowProps: {
    ref: (?HTMLElement) => void,
    style: { [string]: string | number },
  },
|}) => Node
```

A function (render prop) that takes as argument an object containing the
following properties:

- **`ref`**: used to retrieve the
  [React refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) of the **popper**
  element.
- **`style`**: contains the necessary CSS styles (React CSS properties) which
  are computed by Popper.js to correctly position the **popper** element.
- **`placement`**: describes the placement of your popper after Popper.js has
  applied all the modifiers that may have flipped or altered the originally
  provided `placement` property. You can use this to alter the style of the
  popper and or of the arrow according to the definitive placement. For
  instance, you can use this property to orient the arrow to the right
  direction.
- **`isReferenceHidden`**: a boolean signifying the reference element is fully
  clipped and hidden from view.
- **`hasPopperEscaped`**: a boolean signifying the popper escapes the reference
  element's boundary (and so it appears detached).
- **`update`**: a function you can ask Popper to recompute your tooltip's
  position . It will directly call the
  [Popper#update](../../../docs/v2/lifecycle/#manual-update) method.
- **`arrowProps`**: an object, containing `style` and `ref` properties that are
  identical to the ones provided as the first and second arguments of
  `children`, but relative to the **arrow** element. The `style` property
  contains `left` and `top` offset values, which are used to center the arrow
  within the popper. These values can be merged with further custom styling and
  positioning. See
  [the demo](https://github.com/FezVrasta/react-popper/blob/8994933c430e48ab62e71495be71e4f440b48a5a/demo/styles.js#L100)
  for an example.

### `innerRef`

```js
innerRef?: (?HTMLElement) => void
```

Function that can be used to obtain popper reference

### `placement`

```js
placement?: PopperJS$Placement;
```

One of the accepted placement values listed in the
[Popper.js documentation](../../../docs/v2/constructors/#options).  
Your popper is going to be placed according to the value of this property.  
Defaults to `bottom`.

### `strategy`

Describes the positioning strategy to use. By default, it is `absolute`, which
in the simplest cases does not require repositioning of the popper. If your
reference element is in a `fixed` container, use the `fixed` strategy.

### `modifiers`

```js
modifiers?: PopperJS$Modifiers;
```

An object containing custom settings for the
[Popper.js modifiers](../../../docs/v2/modifiers/).  
You can use this property to override their settings or to inject your custom
ones.
